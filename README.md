**DISCLAIMER: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!!!**

This repo shows you how to appear as typing forever on Discord..
1. In the Discord app (or website), open up developer tools (this varies from browser to browser, but for Chrome it's CTRL + SHIFT + I)
2. Head over to the network tab and start typing in the channel that you want to appear typing in
3. Look for "typing" > right click it > hover over copy to show all options > copy as fetch
4. Paste it into the template under the comment
